1. Introduction to Cyber Security

Cyber security refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks aim to access, modify, or destroy sensitive information, disrupt services, or exploit systems for financial or political gain. Cyber security is essential in today’s digital world because individuals and organizations rely heavily on online services such as banking, communication, and cloud storage.

2. CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

The CIA Triad is the foundation of cyber security. It represents three key principles that ensure information security.

2.1 Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.

Example (Banking App):
Only the account holder can view their bank balance and transaction details using a secure login and password.

Example (Social Media):
Private messages on social media platforms are visible only to the sender and receiver.

2.2 Integrity

Integrity ensures that data is accurate and has not been altered without authorization.

Example (Banking App):
Transaction amounts should not change during transfer from user to bank server.

Example (Social Media):
Profile information should not be modified by unauthorized users.

2.3 Availability

Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed.

Example (Banking App):
Users should be able to access their bank accounts anytime without service downtime.

Example (Social Media):
Social media platforms should remain accessible even during high traffic.

3. Types of Cyber Attackers
3.1 Script Kiddies

Script kiddies are beginners who use ready-made hacking tools without understanding how they work.

Why they attack:
For fun, curiosity, or to show off.

Example:
Using free tools to deface a website.

3.2 Insiders

Insiders are employees or trusted individuals within an organization who misuse their access.

Why they attack:
Revenge, financial gain, or negligence.

Example:
An employee leaking company data.

3.3 Hacktivists

Hacktivists attack systems to promote political or social causes.

Why they attack:
To spread ideology or protest against organizations or governments.

Example:
Defacing a government website to spread a political message.

3.4 Nation-State Actors

Nation-state attackers are government-sponsored groups conducting cyber espionage.

Why they attack:
To steal sensitive data, disrupt infrastructure, or gain strategic advantage.

Example:
Cyber attacks on power grids or defense systems.

4. Attack Surfaces

An attack surface is any point where an attacker can try to enter or extract data from a system.

4.1 Web Applications

Web applications are accessed through browsers and are exposed to the internet.

Why vulnerable:
Poor input validation, weak authentication.

Example attack:
SQL Injection on login pages.

4.2 Mobile Applications

Mobile apps store and transmit sensitive data.

Why vulnerable:
Insecure storage, weak encryption.

Example attack:
Stealing user credentials from a compromised app.

4.3 APIs

APIs allow systems to communicate with each other.

Why vulnerable:
Lack of authentication and authorization.

Example attack:
Unauthorized access to user data via exposed APIs.

4.4 Networks

Networks connect devices and systems.

Why vulnerable:
Misconfigured firewalls and open ports.

Example attack:
Man-in-the-middle attacks.

4.5 Cloud Infrastructure

Cloud systems store large volumes of data online.

Why vulnerable:
Misconfigured access controls.

Example attack:
Publicly exposed cloud storage buckets.

5. OWASP Top 10 (Overview)

OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks. These vulnerabilities are dangerous because they are commonly exploited and can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and financial loss. Examples include SQL Injection, Broken Authentication, and Security Misconfiguration.

6. Mapping Daily-Use Applications to Attack Surfaces
Application	Attack Surface	Possible Risk
Email	Web Application	Phishing
WhatsApp	Mobile App	Account takeover
Banking App	Mobile/Web App	Data theft
7. Data Flow and Attack Points

Data Flow:
User → Application → Server → Database

User: Phishing and credential theft

Application: Input validation attacks

Server: Unauthorized access

Database: Data breaches and data manipulation

8. Conclusion

This task helped build a strong understanding of cyber security fundamentals. By learning about the CIA Triad, types of attackers, and attack surfaces, I gained awareness of how cyber threats occur and how systems can be protected against them.
